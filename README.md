Informational Studies: Internet and Society Week 1

When you hear the words “self-portrait,” what comes to mind? For me, I thought I drawing a picture of my face would expose my unartistic abilities. Although that is the literal meaning of a self-portrait, with the use of html, I was able to interpret the concept of a self-portrait in any way I wanted to. At first, the thought of my background and ethnicities came to mind, but that was too basic. I then realized that I wanted to create a self-portrait of the aspects of my life that got me here today. That was living the life as a student and an athlete. Without them, I wouldn’t be going to the prestigious UCLA. Being a student and an athlete are on opposite sides of the spectrum. You were either a nerd or a jock, but I was both. This explains the layout of my webpage. I split the page into halves to emphasize the contrast of the two, but I still included them both on the same page because they define who I am. The title text box and the “Next Chapter” text box are meant to seal the two aspects together, signifying the meaning of who I am, and how I will continue to live this life going into college. The color background of course symbolizes UCLA and shows how much effort it took to get into the university for both the “student” and “athlete” parts of my life. All the pictures in the self-portrait give you a taste of who I am. They are fairly recent photos but it helps reflect the maturity of the topic as well. Overall, I had a great time completing the html self-portrait of myself because it made realize who I really am, and it gives me peace of mind that someone can be inspired by experiences.  

The most difficult part of creating my self-portrait was definitely understanding how html works. It took many hours of learning, but I eventually got the gist of it. Adding the interactive features such as the hover effect, tab bar, and links were especially the most difficult. I never knew anything about coding, which made it more frustrating with the problems that occurred. I have to say that finishing the portrait was probably one of the most satisfying experiences. My ability to learn something I had no clue of before put a smile on my face. Many of us are learning and excelling in the technology field. This project gave me more insight to what the Internet is really capable of. In “Alternate and Activist New Media” by Leah A. Lievrouw, it says, “In the field of communication, scholars have taken several approaches to defining media and communication technologies over time.” It’s so ironic to notice that I’m one of those students pursuing knowledge to define media technologies. The readings definitely connected to the portrait in a surprisingly way. The ideas reflected in the project and readings spiked my interest in the technology world, and I can’t wait to learn and understand more of it.
